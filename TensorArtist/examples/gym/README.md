## Basic A3C-Continous on Box2D environment: `desc_a3cc_box2d_LunarLanderContinuousV2.py`

This model does not follows the original settings in DeepMind's paper, which use:
1. LSTM model.
2. Episode-as-a-batch update.
3. Gaussian distribution.

In this model, we included several tricks for the training:
1. Truncated Laplacian distribution for policy.
2. Positive advantage only update.

Details can be found in the code.
